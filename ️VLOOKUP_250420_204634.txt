To solve the queries using the VLOOKUP function in Excel, follow these steps for each one. Assume the dataset is in the range A2:E22, with headers in row 2:

1. Find the Part Name for Part Number “A002”

Formula:

=VLOOKUP("A002", B3:E22, 2, FALSE) 

Steps:

• Place your cursor in a blank cell.

• Enter the formula above.

• It looks in column B for "A002" and returns the value from the 2nd column in the range, which is "alternator".

2. Find the Supplier ID for the Part Name “Ball Joint”

Formula:

=VLOOKUP("Ball Joint", C3:E22, 1, FALSE) 

BUT since "Supplier ID" is to the left of "Part Name", VLOOKUP cannot retrieve left-side values. Use INDEX & MATCH instead:

=INDEX(A3:A22, MATCH("Ball Joint", C3:C22, 0)) 

Result: SP318

3. Find the Part Price for Part Name “muffler”

Formula:

=VLOOKUP("muffler", C3:E22, 2, FALSE) 

Result: 1600

4. Find the Status of Part Number “A008”

Formula:

=VLOOKUP("A008", B3:E22, 4, FALSE) 

Result: stock

Summary of VLOOKUP Use:
QueryFormulaPart Name for Part Number “A002”
=VLOOKUP("A002", B3:E22, 2, FALSE)

Supplier ID for Part Name “Ball Joint”
=INDEX(A3:A22, MATCH("Ball Joint", C3:C22, 0)) 
(VLOOKUP not suitable)

Part Price for Part Name “muffler” =VLOOKUP("muffler", C3:E22, 2, FALSE)

Status of Part Number “A008” =VLOOKUP("A008", B3:E22, 4, FALSE)
